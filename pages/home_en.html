            Hi, my name is Jakub, and I am a biotechnologist, chemical technologist, and data analyst, with a passion for science and development. I gained my professional experience through various internships, including at the Institute of Human Genetics PAS in Poznań, the Department of Pathomorphology PUM in Szczecin, and the RinderAllianz GmbH laboratory in Germany. I have always been actively involved in scientific life – serving as the chair and member of scientific clubs, organizing conference trips where I presented my research and received awards.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently completing my PhD and research projects at the Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry PAS in Poznań. In this role, I have worked as a data analyst in biomedical sciences and actively participated in laboratory work. I have been involved in projects related to drug safety, genetic therapy design, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain imaging. My responsibilities included advanced data analysis, software and database development, as well as planning and coordinating tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now continuing my professional journey by developing my own projects, such as JBioSysteme© – a proprietary set of tools for analyzing biological data, which you can check out in the Softwares section. On a daily basis, I use Linux (Bash), Windows (PowerShell), programming languages R and Python, Docker containerization, and many other essential tools for project development and requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            My career goal is to combine the benefits of academic research with the private sector and to promote close collaboration between these two sectors. More information about my professional and scientific activities can be found elsewhere on this page.
